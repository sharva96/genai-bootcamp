Persona definitions for the web chatbot.
Each persona is a structured system prompt with the six recommended sections
(identity, capabilities, out-of-scope, tone, format, safety).

A persona may set "rag": True. RAG-enabled personas have the relevant chunks of
the knowledge base (see app/rag.py) retrieved per turn and injected as grounding
context before the model answers. 'Sage' is the demo's grounded persona.
